# NER_BERT_pytorch
Application of BERT with PyTorch for NER using the few-nerd dataset.

## Overview

This project uses the BERT model for performing NER. BERT is a transformer-based model that has achieved state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks. The pre-trained BERT model is fine-tuned on a NER dataset to recognize and classify entities.

This project is mainly based on Abishek Thakur's implementation, [seen here](https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/bert-entity-extraction/tree/master)

## Installation
